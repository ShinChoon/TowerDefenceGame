# Project plan feedback
* The project idea is fun!
* The program structure is good, though you still might be able to refine it a bit. Now it seems that your UI class kind of ties everything together. It might be more idiomatic if you had a Game class that takes care of handling current map, current wave, and wallet etc. Then your UI class could focus on drawing things to screen & playing sounds. You can definitely get your current model to work as well, though.
* The planned schedule looks good.
